# bspwm-config-files
These are my personal config files.  
I'm posting them here as a backup, but if you found it by any chance, feel free to use it.  
I will try to improve that so in case if someone(could be me) forgot what the commands means or just don't know, it will explain it.  
That's it, stay safe whoever reading this ‚ù§
